## Why Gens Julia?

> [Gens Julia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_gens) or Julia gens was one of the most ancient patrician families in ancient Rome.

I want to do more than `Julia.jl`, such as:
- Marking pre-1.0, deprecated, or non-existent packages and links.
- Utilizing the capabilities of [docsifyjs](https://docsify.js.org/) e.g. full text search.
